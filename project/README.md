    ####Description:
    I have made Basic Tic-Tac-Toe game.The game is a C.U.I.It accounts for all possible cases of the game.
    I'm an Economics Major Graduate and want pursue career in Computer Science.I've used extensive if-else blocks to prevent raising exceptions.In some time,I would like to implement A GUI for this game.


    ##Tic-Tac-Toe Game

    This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. The game allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other. The players take turns to mark their symbol ('X' or 'O') on the game board (a 3x3 grid). The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the game board is filled up and no player has three symbols in a row, the game ends in a draw.

    Certainly! Below is an example of a README.md description for a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python. You can include this content in your README.md file to provide an overview of your Tic-Tac-Toe game project.


    ####Gameplay:

    The game will display an empty 3x3 grid representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
    Players take turns entering the row and column number where they want to place their symbol.
    For example, entering 1 2 will place your symbol in the first row, second column.
    The game continues until a player wins or the board is full.
